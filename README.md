## MILESTONES
- Conceptualized a portable eBook reader for blind which allows the user to feel the Braille characters embossed on a 3D printed ring through precise movement of a stepper motor with Bluetooth, Capacitive touch, Audio Output, Learning Mode and Obstacle Categorisation.

- Smart stick and Headgear were used to detect obstacles like wall, small, medium, stairs and head level obstacles and NRF module was used to communicate data to the braille box and obstacle is communicated to the user using audio or vibrational feedback.

- Made a Small finger module consisting of radar, vibrator & ATtiny85, which provided vibrational feedback depending on the obstacle distance so that the blind person can walk fast in the firendly environment or run in ground.
