## THE STICK
Stick is an integral part of the life of blind people when that person wants to walk around without getting any injuries. But what if we can tell that person about the obstacle when it is in font of the person. Here we are able to categorize the obstacles in 5 categories using the stick and using the headgear we can tell if their are any head level obstacles or not and in what direction that head level obstacle is present. We have a finger module as well which the blind person can wear on fingers and will get the vibrational feedback as the obstacles come in front of him/her.
